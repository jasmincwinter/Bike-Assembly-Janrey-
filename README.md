* Consolidate duplicated folders, like Materials and "materials 1" into a single directory.
* Use a common naming scheme; if directories are uppercase, make them all uppercase!
* Make sure all assets are in the correctly directories (LevelList, ListTrigger and reverseList are not, among others).
* "Meshes" or "Models" is a bit more specific than "3D Assets".
* Some directories at the root contain _your_ assets, while some contain third party assets. This can make it difficult at a glance to know which is what for someone new to the project. I recommend either placing all third party assets in a single directory ("External Assets", "Imported", whatever) or placing all _your_ asset directories in a single directory ("Bike Assembly"). I use the latter for my projects.
* Make sure to remove unused assets and scenes. I will cover a way to organize "experiment" kind of assets.
